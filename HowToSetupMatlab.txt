How to set up matlab on windows:

- copy startup, matlabrc, defaults, gdefaults and addir to programFiles/matlab/toolbox/local
(you will overwrite matlabrc)
- set an environment variable 'HOME' (e.g. H:), which is the directory in which you store your personal matlab folder (the one with all the code)
- as a subfolder of $HOME, make a folder 'matlab'
- as a subfolder of 'matlab', make a folder 'common'. This is the folder where the general-purpose code is stored
- right-click on 'common', select "checkout..."
- set as the URL http://lccb-svn.scripps.edu/matlab/projects/common/main
- give your username/password (this is your normal login name)
- now you should see a long list of functions being added
- if you need code from other projects, create a folder and check out again. Always get .../projects/$YOURPROJECTNAME/main


check that everything went well by starting matlab. Does the reminder to get all the new files appear? Can you open a viewpanel (command: uiviewpanel)?

Have fun! :-)
